  abstract={Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly flexible predictive models. However, reliably quantifying uncertainty for their predictions is a continuing challenge. This work proposes a localized recalibration of ANN predictive distributions using the dimension-reduced representation of the input provided by the ANN hidden layers, demonstrating improved prediction and uncertainty quantification in real-world applications.},
