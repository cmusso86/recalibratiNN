# recalibratiNN

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This package aims to provide post processing methods to recalibrate fited models.

![](man/figures/recalibratiNN.png){width="407"}library(devtools)

## Installation

You can install the development version of recalibratiNN from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cmusso86/recalibratiNN")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem using the fuction PIT_values() to obtain pit-values for the fitted model for a calibration set.

```{r example}
library(recalibratiNN)
## basic example code

n = 100000

mu <- function(x1){
 10 + 5*x1^2
 }

 sigma_v <- function(x1){
 30*x1
 }
 
x <- runif(n, 2, 20)
y <- rnorm(n, mu(x), sigma_v(x))

x_test <- x[1:80000]
y_test <- y[1:80000]

x_cal <- x[80001:100000]
y_cal <- y[80001:100000]

mod <- lm(y_test ~ x_test)

cdf <- CDF_model_lm(x_cal=x_cal, model=mod)
pit <- PIT_values_lm( y_cal, cdf)
head(pit)
```

Then, one can proceed with visualizin this the histogram and testing if it fits a uniform distribution.

```{r }
hist(pit)
```

In this case, since we are fiting an lm(0 to an heterocedastic model, the histogram seems shifted indication a misscalibration. You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also test if these values fit a uniform distribution.

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
 ks.test(pit,runif(10000, -1,1))
```

in this case we see the distribution doest seem to fit an uniform distribution.
