# recalibratiNN

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This package aims to provide post processing methods to recalibrate fited models.

![](man/figures/recalibratiNN.png){style="image-align: center;" width="200"}

## Installation

You can install the development version of recalibratiNN from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cmusso86/recalibratiNN")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem using the fuction PIT_values() to obtain pit-values for the fitted model for a calibration set.

```{r example}
library(recalibratiNN)
## basic example code
set.seed(42)
n <- 10000
split <- 0.8

# generating heterocedastic data
mu <- function(x1){
10 + 5*x1^2
}

sigma_v <- function(x1){
30*x1
}

# slipting data 

x <- runif(n, 1, 10)
y <- rnorm(n, mu(x), sigma_v(x))

x_train <- x[1:(n*split)]
y_train <- y[1:(n*split)]

x_cal <- x[(n*split+1):n]
y_cal <- y[(n*split+1):n]

# fitting a simple linear model
model <- lm(y_train ~ x_train)

y_hat <- predict(model, newdata=data.frame(x_train=x_cal))

MSE_cal <- mean((y_hat - y_cal)^2)

pit <- PIT_global(ycal=y_cal, yhat=y_hat, mse=MSE_cal)

head(pit)
```

Then, one can proceed with visualizing this the histogram and testing if it fits a uniform distribution.

```{r }
gg_PIT_global(pit)
```

In this case, since we are fiting an lm() to an heterocedastic model, the histogram seems shifted indication a misscalibration. In the image we also present the p_value from the hispothesis testing of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, performed with the `ks.test()` function from `stats` package.
