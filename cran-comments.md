## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

As soon as it was available on CRAN other authors noticed many typos in the documentation that needed correction. Also, the description filed of each function was improved. Nothing was changed in the code. 

I also included a sentence in the main DESCRIPTION file to emphasize the theoretical background.

I hope it is alright. Thanks for the patience.
