Improvement in the documentation of the functions and correction of typos.

Inclusion of a vignette with application on a Neural Network.

Inclusion of a new reference (my undergrad thesis) for see a more detailed documentation of the functions. I also included the link of this work on the description file. However, as it does not have a DOI, I dont know if I did it correctly.
